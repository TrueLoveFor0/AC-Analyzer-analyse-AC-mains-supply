# AC-Analyzer Frequency-Monitoring- with- programming
Analyze AC frequency, send high precision results over USB (serial).    
Build averages or out of range indicators. Check for power outages, brown outs etc. Measure anywhere you see a wall socket or outlet.

Works an any device that can do USB serial (Win, Linux, Android, Raspy etc.)

## Security
AC-Analyzer is designed to comply with VDE distance regulations. Anything possible was done to stay secure. However, this devices works with life-endangering voltages. Do not even think to use it when you are untrained and/or have no experience with high voltages or not the needed equipment for secure usage. Usage is at your own risk.
