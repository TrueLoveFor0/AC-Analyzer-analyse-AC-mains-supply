Whether you're an electronics hobbyist, a professional developer, or an educational institution, this project provides a versatile platform for exploring AC frequency measurement and IoT technologies. Join us in innovating smarter solutions for today's energy management needs!

## Security
AC-Analyzer is designed to comply with VDE distance regulations. Anything possible was done to stay secure. However, this devices works with life-endangering voltages. Do not even think to use it when you are untrained and/or have no experience with high voltages. Useage is at your own risk.
