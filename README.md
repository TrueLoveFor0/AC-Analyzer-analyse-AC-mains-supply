# AC-Analyzer Frequency-Monitoring- with- programming
Analyze AC frequency, send high precision results over USB (serial).    
Build averages or out of range indicators. Works an any devecie that can do USB serial (Win, Linux, Android, Raspy etc.)

## Security
AC-Analyzer is designed to comply with VDE distance regulations. Anything possible was done to stay secure. However, this devices works with life-endangering voltages. Do not even think to use it when you are untrained and/or have no experience with high voltages or not the needed equipment for secure usage. Usage is at your own risk.
